# Ring
## Development Repository

Package ring contains tools for building and using a consistent hashing ring
with replicas, automatic partitioning (ring ranges), and keeping replicas of
the same partitions in as distinct tiered nodes as possible (tiers might be
devices, servers, cabinets, rooms, data centers, geographical regions, etc.)

It also contains tools for using a ring as a messaging hub, easing
communication between nodes in the ring.

This is the latest development area for the package.  
Eventually a stable version of the package will be established but, for now,
all things about this package are subject to change.
